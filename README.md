Crowdfunding Goal Analysis

GIVEN THE PROVIDED DATA, WHAT ARE THREE CONCLUSIONS THAT WE CAN DRAW ABOUT CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGNS?

1.	Out of 1,000 crowdfunding campaigns 34.4% of them used “theater/plays” to support their campaign. This makes it the most popular category/sub-category shown in the crowdfunding data sheet.
2.	The least popular category used for crowdfunding campaigns is “journalism” being used at only 0.4%. However, “journalism” also had the highest success rate out of all the other parent categories at 100%.
3.	The parent category with the most failed crowdfunding campaigns is “games” at a 47.9% failure rate.

WHAT ARE SOME LIMITATIONS OF THIS DATASET?

One of the limitations to this dataset is that it is lacking information on the demographics that these events were being marketed to. It is important to attract the right demographic to reach the campaign goal. There is no information on the resources used to create/support the campaign and people’s experience with the campaign. This would give information on the overall quality of the campaign and can provide even more insight into finding “the trick” to success.

WHAT ARE SOME OTHER POSSIBLE TABLES AND/OR GRAPHS THAT WE COULD CREATE, AND WHAT ADDITIONAL VALUE WOULD THEY PROVIDE?

Another type of table/graph that could be used is a box plot, it can display the overall spread and any outliers in the number of backers for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.



The median best summarizes this data.

There is a much larger variability in successful campaigns due to some of them raising over 200% of their initial goal.
